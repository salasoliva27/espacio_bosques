I need you to set up and run the Espacio Bosques project automatically. Follow these steps in order:

STEP 1: CHECK PREREQUISITES
First, check if Node.js and Yarn are installed by running these commands:
- node --version
- npm --version
- yarn --version

If ANY of these commands fail:
1. Tell me Node.js and/or Yarn are missing
2. Guide me to install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/ (download LTS version)
3. After I confirm Node.js is installed, run: npm install -g yarn
4. Then proceed to STEP 2

If all commands succeed, proceed directly to STEP 2.

STEP 2: VERIFY ENVIRONMENT CONFIGURATION
Check if the .env file exists in the project root. If it doesn't exist:
1. Copy .env.example to .env
2. Ask me for these required credentials:
   - DATABASE_URL: Supabase PostgreSQL connection string (format: postgresql://postgres:PASSWORD@HOST.supabase.co:5432/postgres?schema=public)
   - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: Anthropic Claude API key (format: sk-ant-api03-...)
3. Update the .env file with the credentials I provide

STEP 3: RUN THE AUTOMATED SETUP
Execute the setup-and-run.ps1 PowerShell script by running:
.\setup-and-run.ps1

This script will automatically:
- Install all project dependencies (contracts, backend, frontend)
- Start Hardhat blockchain node in the background
- Deploy smart contracts to the local blockchain
- Run Prisma migrations on the Supabase database
- Seed the database with test data (including Drone Vigilance project)
- Start the backend API server in the background
- Start the frontend React application in the background

STEP 4: MONITOR THE SETUP PROGRESS
Watch for these success messages:
- "✓ Dependencies installed"
- "✓ Hardhat node running at http://localhost:8545"
- "✓ Smart contracts deployed"
- "✓ Database schema created"
- "✓ Database seeded with test data"
- "✓ Backend running at http://localhost:3001"
- "✓ Frontend running at http://localhost:5173"

STEP 5: VERIFY SERVICES ARE RUNNING
Once the setup completes, verify all services:
- Check Hardhat: curl http://localhost:8545 (should respond)
- Check Backend: curl http://localhost:3001/health (should return {"status":"ok"})
- Check Frontend: curl http://localhost:5173 (should respond with HTML)

STEP 6: PROVIDE ME THE LINKS
Once everything is running successfully, provide me with these clickable links:
- Dashboard: http://localhost:5173/dashboard
- Create Project: http://localhost:5173/create
- Backend API: http://localhost:3001
- Backend Health: http://localhost:3001/health

STEP 7: EXPLAIN THE DEMO
Tell me how to test the Drone Vigilance demo:
1. Open http://localhost:5173/dashboard
2. Click on "Bosques Forest Drone Vigilance" project
3. View the 4 milestones, funding progress (30,000/50,000 BOSQUES), and live telemetry
4. Click "View AI Reports" → "Generate New Report"
5. Watch Claude AI analyze 30 drone telemetry events and generate insights

TROUBLESHOOTING:
If any step fails:
- For port conflicts: Kill processes on ports 8545, 3001, 5173
- For database connection errors: Verify the DATABASE_URL in .env
- For contract deployment errors: Ensure Hardhat node is running first
- For AI report errors: Verify ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in .env

STOPPING SERVICES:
When I want to stop all services, run:
.\stop-services.ps1

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- All background processes will continue running even if I close the terminal
- The script creates PID/job files to track running processes
- Logs are written to: hardhat.log, backend.log, frontend.log
- The test credentials are already configured and should work as-is
- The Supabase database is cloud-hosted, so no local database setup needed

Now, execute all steps automatically and only stop to ask me for input if:
1. Node.js or Yarn is not installed
2. Any critical error occurs that prevents continuation
3. All services are successfully running (then provide me the links)

Begin now.
